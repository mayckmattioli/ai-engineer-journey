I completed modules 1 and 2 of the Python for Everybody course.
Dr. Charles Severance gave an overview of the course and emphasized that we will feel frustrated at times, but we will learn and eventually get it with time and practice.
I installed Python and Visual Studio Code, and wrote my first program – “Hello, world!”

In linear algebra, I studied vectors – addition and scalar multiplication.
